## A University Databases Coursework that consists of 3 parts:
  1. Design and develop an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
  2. Write relational schema and integrity constraints for your relations. Provide the relevant SQL DDL statements to implement your ERD.
  3. Create a java library containing methods to read given .csv files that match the supplied example ô€ƒžles and generate the relevant SQL insert statements to populate the database, and Create a set of SQL queries to answer 5 given questions

## Prerequisite to run the code in Milestone 3
  - You must have Java Installed on your Machine to compile the code
  - You must always keep "sqlite3.exe" file in the "Milestone 3" Folder OR have sqlite3 installed on your machine
  - You must always keep "sqlite-jdbc-3.20.1.jar" file in the "Milestone 3" Folder
  - You must have the "Combat.csv", "Customers.csv" & "Items.csv" files to populate the Database (Also you can change the contents of the files to suit your case)
